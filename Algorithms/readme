You can modify the simulation parameters in the Main.java
All algorithms (scale in, scale out, load-balancing) are in the Algorithms.java
APIs for OpenNF or other flow migration framework are left in the Algorithms.java
CSVUtils.java is the CSV output class to export the simulation data.

To run the simulation correctly, you need to download the lpsolve and install it.
